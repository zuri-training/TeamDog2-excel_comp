# Excel_comp
A platform that helps users compare the content of excel files.

Many users who regularly work with Excel spreadsheets find it difficult to directly compare excel documents with similar
contents using the built-in compare feature of most spreadsheet applications because it lacks the functionality
 to make comprehensive comparisons and spot all the key differences at once.
